//! Level L5 in `scripts/crate_split/boundaries.toml` (MEDULLA-CONTRACT-R056.11); it may depend only
//! on crates of a lower level. Budget: 25,000 lines of Rust. Specs that land here: decision-engine (assembly and task planning).
//! Route new rows with `scripts/crate_split/route_rows.py`.

#![allow(dead_code)] // moved helper code, as the facade crate did
#![allow(unused_imports)] // glob imports carried over from the facade; the visibility pass prunes them
